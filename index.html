                        As we all know, it’s easy for marketers to brag about 
                        how great their product or service is. Writing compelling 
                        copy, shooting enticing photos, or even producing glamorous 
                        videos are all tactics we use to draw attention to our brands. 
                        While all of these strategies can be successful, there really 
                        is no better way to gain trust and prove the validity of your 
                        brand like customer testimonials.

                        ZenDesk’s testimonial page is beautifully laid out 
                        AND functional, with a silent customer video playing 
                        on loop to serve as the banner, a menu to filter 
                        testimonials by location, company size, industry, 
                        and use case, and lastly thumbnails linking to the 
                        full customer stories for a variety of big-name brands. 
                        This is a clean and concise way 
                        to showcase their happy customers.
